# Password-Generator
This app will create passwords that can be utilized by the user to secure anything that uses passwords.
The first input will be to create the passwords length.
The second input will create the passwords in the ammount that the user enters, that way the user can choose from a list of passwords.
If there are other characters that you would like to add to the characters list you can add them easily, just as you can remove any that may not fit your passwords requirements.
Thank you
